# Qt3DViewer
openmesh + qt
You can configure the specific version of OpenMesh and Qt. I use OpenMesh 8.1 that is the latest version and Qt5.15.2. This project is derived from QtViewer which exists in Apps in the directory of OpenMesh source code. I just modified some code snippets of header files and used CMake to generate the Visual Studio 2019 project.
